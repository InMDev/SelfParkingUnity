# SelfParkingUnity
Using Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm for self parallel parking in Unity from scratch

# The idea
1. Create movement to the car: engine & steering wheel
2. Give sensor that calculate distance near the car
3. Give Brain to the car that takes in the sensor values and outputs the engine & steering wheel strength
4. Define a loss function, Train & Evolve the model to find the best weights.
